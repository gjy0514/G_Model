This paper mainly introduces a data association method based on quadratic graph matching. We construct a graph with the objects in each frame as vertices. In addition to using vertex information, edge information encoding instance-wise relations is also considered. That is, using structure information to make data association more stable and accurate. We conduct a series of experiments on MOTchallenge and KITTI datasets. By replacing the data association part of some methods and then comparing them, our methods have achieved better results.
